# Release and legacy storage completion decisions

The operator completed the current approval questions on 14 September 2026.
Resume implementation and reviewed isolated commits; avoid repeat confirmation
for these already authorized steps.

## Release configuration

- The exact production-only GitHub OIDC Trusted Sources rule is approved and
  applied. It binds canonical repository `gadicc/magick.ly`, immutable repository
  ID `271738405`, branch `master`, GitHub environment `Production`, and workflow
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Vercel returned the exact reviewed state.
- GitHub Production setup is approved, including a Vercel deployment credential.
  Prefer a project-scoped credential after verifying current provider support
  and the actual release commands. Team scope was also explicitly approved as
  the previously proposed path, but must not be a silent fallback.
- Implement shared Loom improvements: explicit scope/expiry and rotation,
  preservation of existing credentials on rerun, safe partial-failure handling,
  branch-policy verification, and shared Trusted Sources planning/checks.
- Validate through Magickly first. Other consumers adopt through their own
  reviewed workflows and dependency changes.

Trusted Sources grants HTTP access through Deployment Protection. Deployment API
credentials remain a separate permission. Applying the trust rule did not
deploy Magickly, run migrations or pause writes.

The applied state SHA-256 is
`52126d15dbe25d2df4497832165c239bdcbbbab902059aaba40f6ae7af6cd763`.
The exact patch file SHA-256 is
`17c9822730efe13d2b7369ae74d3745be39ea9981b00cad943edf9bc793cb782`.
Credential-free review and guarded runner are under
`/tmp/magickli-trusted-sources-*`; the decision ledger is
`/tmp/magickli-modernization-approval-decisions.json`.

## Existing files and consolidation

Fresh read-only Vercel Production inspection confirms that existing uploads use
Cloudflare R2 bucket `magickly` via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Despite their AWS names, these are the existing R2
application credentials. Original object bytes remain there; Mongo contains the
file metadata. Earlier direct-provider and public-route checks verified all ten
inventoried files, 7,790,234 bytes, against the backup sizes and SHA-256 hashes.
No original objects were moved or deleted.

On 14 September, a fresh complete source listing contained exactly those ten
objects and no extras. The reviewed runner copied all ten to
`magickli-files-production/legacy-file2/<sha256>` using conditional writes,
then verified destination sizes, actual SHA-256 hashes and historical Mongo
MIME types. Source inventory and all backup fingerprints remained unchanged.
This is a preliminary copy while the legacy site remains live: repeat final
reconciliation after fencing writers and verify destination bytes after import
before inserting SQL relocation evidence. No SQL mappings have been activated.
The exact reviewed copy-plan digest is
`b562af14b75892fcdd94f7412c64fcc63a5df359110f3a0b8b048a05cd1a3ccd`;
the completed report is
`/tmp/magickli-legacy-file-relocation/copy-17586a29-956c-4ac3-947d-d51196e009d4.json`.
The same-plan rerun verified all ten destinations again and reused every object
with zero PUT attempts; its report is
`/tmp/magickli-legacy-file-relocation/copy-fb3d8501-26ab-4e38-8b24-444251c776ac.json`.

The operator approved separate Object Read & Write credentials for
`magickli-files-production` and `magickli-files-preview`, each restricted to its
own bucket and corresponding Vercel environment. The operator supplied them
through the hidden-input helper. Both passed direct object PUT/GET and SHA-256
verification; each was denied access to the other's existing test object with
HTTP 403. All disposable test objects were removed.

Four credential variables are installed as Vercel Sensitive values, alongside
ten non-secret settings, only in their matching Production/Preview environments.
Development and the old AWS-named variables remain unchanged. Metadata and
non-secret values were read back and verified. These checks establish the
tested object permissions, not an exhaustive audit of token privileges.
Reports are under `/tmp/magickli-r2-setup-proposal/`, including
`vercel-storage-configuration.json`. The mode-0600 credential handoff file is
temporarily retained for the approved legacy copy and storage acceptance, then
must be deleted; Vercel does not return Sensitive values after installation.

The approved end state is one production bucket, one preview bucket, unchanged
legacy public URLs, and no runtime dependency on the old storage credentials:

1. Inventory the complete old bucket and all consumers. Reconcile later uploads
   and extra objects; fence old upload writers before final reconciliation.
2. Copy legacy files into a dedicated prefix in the new production bucket with
   resumable, conditional writes and verified destination size/SHA-256.
3. Retain original import evidence and record verified destination mappings.
   Switch both the legacy public reader and ritual publication image catalog;
   future publications and offline images must also work without old storage.
4. Preserve legacy filenames, MIME types (including SVG), and the exact public
   `/api/file2?sha256=...` URLs. Only the imported legacy-public whitelist may be
   served publicly; the destination bucket stays private.
5. Following deployment acceptance and a rollback window, remove old app storage
   variables and revoke old credentials after checking their full scope and any
   other consumers. The Mongo ownership answer does not establish R2 ownership.
6. Review final bucket inventory and backup evidence before destructive deletion.
   The final deletion operation has not yet been presented or executed.

Relocation is an additional implementation milestone. Both readers need the
verified mapping before switching, and the live legacy deployment still reads
the original bucket. Copying bytes alone does not activate the new runtime.

Migration `0016_volatile_moondragon` adds the application-owned relocation table.
Public reads and ritual publication join its evidence to the original snapshot;
missing evidence retains the source, while mismatched evidence fails closed.
Canonical Files credentials can serve all relocated objects without the old
variables. The import command includes the new migration and requires this table
to be empty during import; final import reconciliation precedes mapping activation.
The foundation passes 453 focused tests, TypeScript, generated-schema refresh,
Biome and Loom checks. The previous live Neon rehearsal covers only 0000–0015;
refresh it after the final dependency pin before production use.

## Write pause and outstanding operational evidence

The operator confirmed that the live MongoDB user is dedicated to Magickly and
approved a short write pause at the appropriate time. Prepare and verify a narrow
reversible fence before the final consistent backup, import and reconciliation.
Historic deployments and in-flight external writes must be covered; see
[the writer review](020-cutover-writers.md).

Preview database ancestry, deployment overrides and readiness still need proof.
Use a schema-only or sanitized preview dataset and isolate external writes before
preview acceptance. No private production import or application deployment has
occurred. The reusable modernization skill remains an unpublished draft until
the complete modernization actually finishes.
