  | watch over the preparation of the candidate and assist in his reception, and I
  | lead him in the path that conducts from darkness to light. The white colour of

  |
  b
    var(name="candidateMotto")
  | , I shall now proceed to instruct you in the secret Step, Signs,
  | Grip and Words of this Grade.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Firstly, advance your left foot a short space, as if entering a portal.
  | This is the Step.
say(role="hiereus")
  | The Signs are two. The First or Saluting Sign is given
  | thus: Lean forward and stretch both arms out thus:
  |
  i (make Neophyte do this)
  | . It alludes to your condition in a state of Darkness, groping for Light.
  | The second Sign is the Sign of Silence, and is given by placing the left
  | forefinger on your lip thus
  |
  i (make Neophyte do this)
  | . It is the position shown in many ancient statues of Harpocrates,
  | and it alludes to the silence you have sworn to maintain concerning
  | everything connected with this Order. The first sign is always answered
  | by the second.
say(role="hiereus")
  | The Grip or Token is given thus: advance your left foot touching mine,
  | toe and heel, extend your right hand to grasp mine, fail, try again,
  | and then succeed in touching the fingers only. It alludes to the
  | seeking guidance in darkness.
say(role="hiereus")
  | The Grand Word is Har-Par-Krat, and it is whispered in this position
  | mouth to ear, in syllables.
  |
  i (They exchange the word.)
  |
  | It is the Egyptian Name for the God of Silence, and should always
  | remind you of the strict silence you have sworn to maintain.
say(role="hiereus")
  | The Password is
  |
  i (word)
  | . It is periodically changed each Equinox, so that a Member who has
  | resigned, demitted, or been expelled, may be in ignorance of the
  | existing Password.
say(role="hiereus")
  i
    | I now place you between the two Pillars of Hermes and of Solomon
    | in the symbolical Gateway of Occult Wisdom.
do(role="hegemon")
  | Ready the Hiereus' sword to give back to him
do(role="hiereus")
  | Leads Neophyte forward and then takes back the Sword and Banner.
  | He stands North East of the Black Pillar and says:

  | the hall as in the opening

say(role="dadouchos") I consecrate thee with fire.
do(role="stolistes,dadouchos") Return to their places

say(role="hierophant")

do(role="all") Take their seats.

do(role="hierophant") Stands.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Threefold Cord bound about your waist was an image of the
  | threefold bondage of Mortality, which amongst the Initiated is
  | called earthly or material inclination, that has bound into a
  | narrow place the once far-wondering Soul; and the Hoodwink was an
  | image of the Darkness, of Ignorance, of Morality that has blinded
  | men to the Happiness and Beauty their eyes once looked upon.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Double Cubical Altar in the centre of the Hall is an emblem of
  | visible Nature or the Material Universe, concealing within herself
  | the mysteries of all dimensions, while revealing her surface to the
  | exterior senses. It is a double cube because, as the Emerald
  | Tablet has said, "The thigs that are below are a reflection of the
  | things that are above." The world of men and women created to
  | unhappiness is a reflection of the World of Divine Being created to
  | Happiness. It is described in the
  |
  i Sepher Yetzirah
  | , or the
  |
  i Book of Formation
  | , as "an Abyss of Height" and as "an Abyss of Depth",
  | "an Abyss of the East" and "an Abyss of the West",
  | "an Abyss of the North" and "an Abyss of the South". The altar is
  | Black because, unlike Divine Beings who unfold in the Element of Light,
  | the Fires of Created Beings arise from Darkness and Obscurity.
say(role="hierophant")
  | On the Altar is a White Triangle to be the Image of that Immortal
  | Light, that Triune Light, which moved in Darkness and formed the
  | world of Darkness and out of Darkness. There are two contending
  | Forces and One always uniting them; and these Three have their
  | Image in the threefold Flame of our Being and in the threefold wave
  | of the sensual world.
do(role="hierophant") Stands in the form of a cross.
say(role="hierophant")
  | Glory be to Thee, Father of the undying.
  | For Thy glory flows out rejoicing to the ends of the earth!
do(role="hierophant") Reseats himself.

say(role="hierophant")
  | The Red Cross above the White Triangle is an Image of Him Who was
  | unfolded in the Light. At its East, South, West and North angles
  | are a Rose, Fire, Cup of Wine, and Bread and Salt. These allude to
  | the Four Elements: Air, Fire, Water, Earth.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Mystical Words —
  |
  i
    | Khabs Am Pekht
  |
  | — are ancient Egyptian, and are the origin of the Greek "Konx Om Pax"
  | which was uttered at the Eleusinian Mysteries. A literal translation
  | would be "Light Rushing Out In One Ray", and they signify the same
  | form of Light as that symbolized by the Staff of the Keryx.
say(role="hierophant")
  | East of the Double Cubical Altar of created things are the Pillars
  | of Hermes and of Solomon. On these are painted certain Hieroglyphics
  | from the 17th and the 125th chapters of the Book of the Dead. They
  | are the symbols of the two powers of Day and Night, Love and Hate,
  | Work and Rest, the subtle force of the Lodestone and the Eternal
  | outpouring and inpouring of the Heart of God.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Lamps that burn, though with a veiled light, upon their summits
  | show that the Pathway to Hidden Knowledge, unlike the Pathway of
  | Nature — which is a continual undulation, the winding hither and
  | tither of the Serpent — is the straight and narrow way between them.
say(role="hierophant")
  | It was because of this that I passed between them, when you came
  | to the Light, and it was because of this that you were placed between
  | them to receive the final consecration.
say(role="hierophant")
  | Two contending Forces and one which unites them externally.
  | Two basal angles of the triangle and one which forms the apex.
  | Such is the origin of Creation — it is the Triad of Life.
say(role="hierophant")
  | My throne at the Gate of the East is the Place of the Guardian of
  | the Dawning Sun.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Throne of the Hiereus at the Gate of the West is the Place of
  | the Guardian Against the Multitudes that sleep through the Light and
  | awaken at the Twilight.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Throne of the Hegemon seated between the Columns is the Place of
  | Balanced Power, between the ultimate Light and the ultimate Darkness.
  | These meanings are shown in detail and by the colour of our Tabards.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Wand of the Keryx is the Beam of Light from the Hidden Wisdom,
  | and his Lamp is an emblem of the Ever-burning Lamp of the Guardian
  | of the Mysteries.
say(role="hierophant")
  | The Seat of the Stolistes at the Gate of the North is the Place
  | of the Guardian of the Couldron and the Well of Water - of Cold
  | and Moisture. The Seat of the Dadouchos at the Gate of the South is
  | the Place of the Guardian of the Lake of Fire and the Burning Bush.

say(role="hierophant")
  | Frater Keryx, I command you to declare that the Neophyte has been
  | initiated into the Mysteries of the
  |
  grade(grade="0=0")
  |
  | Grade.
do(role="keryx") Advances to the North East, faces West and raises his Wand.
say(role="keryx")
  | In the Name of the Lord of the Universe, Who works in
  | Silence and Whom naught but Silence can express, and by command of
  | the Very Honoured Hierophant, hear ye all, that I proclaim that
  |
  b
    var(name="candidateName")
  | , who will henceforth be known to you by the Motto
  |
  b
    var(name="candidateMotto")
  | , has been duly admitted to the
  |
  grade(grade="0=0")
  |
  | Grade as a Neophyte of the
  |
  var(name="orderName")
  | .
do(role="keryx") Returns to his place.

say(role="hierophant")
  | Honoured Hiereus, I delegate to you the duty of
  | pronouncing a short address to our Frater on his admission.
say(role="hiereus") Frater
  |
  |
  b
    var(name="candidateMotto")
  | , it is my duty to deliver this exhortation to you.
  | Remember your Obligation in this Order to secrecy — for
  | Strength is in Silence, and the Seed of Wisdom is sown in Silence
  | and grows in Darkness and Mystery.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Remember that you hold all Religions in reverence, for there is
  | none but contain a Ray from the Ineffable Light that you are
  | seeking. Remember the penalty that awaits the breaker of his
  | Oath. Remember the Mystery that you have received, and that the
  | Secret of Wisdom can be discerned only from the place of Balanced
  | Powers.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Study well the Great Arcanum of the proper equilibrium of Severity
  | and Mercy, for either unbalanced is not good. Unbalanced Severity
  | is cruelty and opression; unbalanced Mercy is but weakness and
  | would permit Evil to exist unchecked, thus making itself, as it
  | were, the accomplice of Evil.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Remember that things Divine are not attained by mortals who understand
  | the Body alone, for only those who are lightly armed can attain the summit.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Remember that God alone is our Light and the Bestower of Perfect
  | Wisdom, and that no mortal power can do more than bring you to the
  | Pathway of that Wisdom, which He could, if it so pleased Him, put into
  | the heart of a child. For as the whole is greater than the part, so
  | are we but Sparks from the unsupportable Light which is in Him.
say(role="hiereus")
  | The ends of the Earth are swept by the Borders of His Garment of
  | Flame — from Him all things proceed, and unto Him all things return.
say(role="hiereus")
  | Therefore, we invoke Him. Therefore even the Banner of the East falls
  | in adoration before Him.

say(role="hierophant")
  | Before you can ask to pass to a higher Grade, you will have to commit
  | certain rudiments of Occult Knowledge to memory. A manuscript lecture
  | in these subjects will be supplied to you by the Chief in whose charge
  | they are. When you can pass an examination in this elementary
  | Qabalistic knowledge, you will inform the Member in whose charge you are,
  | and arrangements will be made for you to sit for examination. If you
  | are found perfect you will then apply for admission to the next
  | Degree. Remember, that without a Dispensation from the Second Order, no
  | person can be admitted or advance to a Grade of the First Order.

do(role="keryx")
  | Conducts Neophyte to his table and gives him one of the small dishes
  | of solution to hold
say(role="keryx")
  | Nature is harmonious in all her workings, and that which is above is
  | as that which is below. Thus also, the Truths which by material
  | Science we investigate, are but special examples of the all-pervading
  | Laws of the Universe. So, within this pure and limpid fluid, lie hidden
  | and unperceived of mortal eyes, the elements bearing the semblance of
  | blood, even as within the mind and brain of the initiate lie concealed
  | the Divine Secrets of the Hidden Knowledge. Yet if the Oath be
  | forgotten, and the solemn pledge broken, then that which is secret
  | shall be revealed, even as this pure fluid reveals the semblance of
  | blood.
do(role="keryx")
  | Adds fluid from the other dish
say(role="keryx")
  | Let this remind thee ever, O Neophyte, how easily by a careless or
  | unthinking word, thou mayst betray that which thou hast sworn to
  | keep secret and mayst reveal the Hidden Knowledge imparted to thee,
  | and planted in thy brain and in thy mind. And let the hue of blood
  | remind thee that if thou shalt fail in this thy Oath of Secrecy, thy
  | blood may be poured out and thy body broken; for heavy is the
  | penalty exacted by the Guardians of the Hidden Knowledge from those
  | who will wilfully betray their trust.

do(role="hierophant") Comes to the table
note The register is signed.
say(role="hierophant")
  | Resume your seat, and remember that your admission
