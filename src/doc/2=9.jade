  | having made such progress in the paths of occult knowledge as has
  | enabled him to pass an examination in the requisite of knowledge,
  | is now eligible for advancement to the grade of Theoricus, and I 
  | have duly received a dispensation from the greatly honoured Chiefs
  | of the Second Order, to advance him in due form.
Hierophant:
  | Honoured Hegemon, superintend the preparation of the Zelator and give
  | the customary alarm.
* Hegemon
  | rises and saluting, quits the temple. He prepares the Zelator
  | by seeing he is robed and wearing his sash, presents him with Greek cubical

  | Hiereus, and salt by his own place.
* Keryx on hearing the alarm, opens the door and allows Hegemon to enter
  | with Zelator, and then closes it.

Hegemon: Quit the material and seek the spiritual.

  | Give me the step and sign of a Zelator. (Done.)
  br

  br
  | Give me the grand word, mystic title, and the mystic number of a Zelator.
  br
  | What is the password formed from the mystic number?
  br
  i This is done, Hegemon prompting if necessary.

Hierophant:
  | Frater Periclinus de Faustis, do you solemnly pledge yourself to
  | maintain the same strict secrecy regarding the mysteries of the thirty-
  | second Path and the 2=9 grade of Theoricus, which you have already
  | sworn to maintain regarding those of the preceding grades?

Candidate: I do.
* Keryx gives back cross to Zelator.

Hierophant:
  | Then you will stretch out your hand, holding the cubical cross
  | towards heaven, and say: “I swear by the Firmament of Heaven.”
* Candidate holds cross high and repeats the words.
  
Hierophant: Let the hoodwink be removed.
note
  i Done.
* Hegemon returns to his place in the south.
* Keryx is now in charge of Zelator.

Hierophant:
  | Stretch forth your right hand, holding the cubical cross towards the
  | east, in the position of the Zelator sign, saying: “Let the powers of air
  | witness my pledge.”
* Candidate does so and repeats the words.
* Hierophant ✊
Hierophant:
  | Facing you are the portals of the thirty-first, thirty-second, and
  | twenty-ninth Paths leading from the grade of Zelator to the
  | three other grades which are beyond. The only Path now open to you,
  | however, is the thirty-second, which leads to the 2=9 grade
  | of Theoricus, and which you must traverse before arriving at that grade.
Hierophant:
  | Take in your right hand the cubical cross and in your left the Banner of
  | Light 
  i (gives it to him)
  |  and follow your guide, Anubis the Guardian, who
  | leads you from the material to the spiritual.
Keryx:
  | Anubis the Guardian said to the aspirant, “Let us enter the presence of
  | the Lord of Truth. Arise and follow me.”

  | turns to the right and leads Zelator round the hall once slowly,
  | while Hiereus reads.
* Hierophant rises with Banner of the West in left hand, fan in right.
Hiereus:
  | The sphinx of Egypt spake and said: “I am the synthesis of the
  | elemental forces. I am also the symbol of man. I am life and I am death. I
  | am the child of the night of time.”
* Keryx,Candidate approach the east
* Hierophant bars the way with the Banner of the West and fan.
Hierophant:
  | The priest with the mask of Osiris spake and said: “Thou canst not
  | pass the gate of the eastern heaven unless thou canst tell me my name.”
Keryx:
  | Thou art Nu, goddess of the Firmament of Air.
  | Thou art Hormaku, lord of the eastern sun.

  | equated forces.

* Keryx leads Zelator on and hands the banner to Hegemon in passing.
Hiereus:
  | I am Osiris, the soul in twin aspect, united to the higher by
  | purification, perfected by suffering, glorified through trial. I have come
  | where the great gods are, through the power of the mighty name.
* Keryx,Candidate have now reached Hegemon
* Hegemon
  | bars their way, lamp in right hand, the Banner of the West in left hand.
Hegemon:
  | The priest with the mask of the lion spake and said: “Thou canst not
  | pass by the gate of the southern heaven unless thou canst tell me my
  | name.”
Keryx:
  | Mau the lion, very powerful, lord of fire, is thy name. Thou art
  | Ra, the sun in his strength.
Hegemon: In what signs and symbols do ye come?
Keryx:
  | In the letter Shin ("ש"), in the Banner of the East, and the symbol of the
  | cubical cross.
* Hegemon stands back and makes the sign of Leo ♌ before Zelator with lamp.
Hegemon: 
  | In the sign of the lion, child of fire, thou art purified. Pass thou on.

* Keryx returns to his seat in the north.
* Hegemon leads Zelator past Hiereus, to whom he hands the Banner of the West.
* Hiereus reads for the third time (see below).
* Hegemon being careful to lead Zelator slowly round the temple, returning to
  | Hiereus when the speech is finished.
Hiereus:
  i (As they go round the third time)
  |  I have passed through the gates
  | of the firmament. Give me your hands, for I am made as ye, ye lords of
  | truth! For ye are the formers of the soul.
* Hiereus
  | puts down sword and stands with cup in right hand, the Banner
  | of the West in left; barring the way of Hegemon and Zelator.
Hiereus:
  | The priest with the mask of the eagle spake and said: “Thou
  | canst not pass the gate of the western heaven unless thou canst tell me
  | my name.”
Hegemon:
  | Heka, mistress of Hesur, ruler of water, is thy name. Thou art Toum,
  | the setting sun.

Hiereus:

  | Thy name is in all things; and before Thee, the shadows of night
  | roll back and the darkness hasteth away.
* Keryx bars the way with salt and the Banner of the West.
Keryx:
  | The priest with the mask of the ox spake and said: “Thou canst not pass
  | the gate of the northern heaven unless thou canst tell me my name.”
Hegemon:
  | Satem in the abode of Shu, the bull of earth, is thy name. Thou art
  | Khephra, the sun at night.
Keryx: In what signs and symbols do ye come?
Hegemon:
  | In the Letters Aleph ("א"), Mem ("מ"), and Shin ("ש"),
  | and in the symbols of banner and cross.
* Keryx stands back, and makes the sign of Taurus ♉ over Zelator with
  | salt.
Keryx:
  | In the sign of the head of the ox, child of the elements, thou art
  | purified. Pass thou on.
* Hegemon leads the Zelator to Hierophant between the pillars.
* Keryx
  | accompanies them with the Banner of the West, which he hands to

* Hierophant replaces Banner of the West on its stand.
* Hegemon
  | hands up the Banner of the East, which Zelator has been holding.
note
  | Banner is replaced.
* Hegemon hands cubical cross to Hierophant.
* Keryx
  | collects the fan, lamp, cup, and salt and replaces them in their right
  | places on the altar, round the diagram.
Hierophant:
  i (Holding cubical cross.) 
  | The cubical cross is a fitting emblem of the equilibrated and
  | balanced forces of the elements. It is composed of twenty-two squares
  | externally, thus referring to the twenty-two letters that
  | are placed thereon. Twenty-two are the letters of the eternal voice, in the
  | vault of heaven; in the depth of earth; in the abyss of water; in the all-
  | presence of fire. Heaven cannot speak their fullness — earth cannot utter it.
Hierophant:
  | Yet hath the Creator bound them in all things. He hath mingled them in
  | water. He hath whirled them aloft in fire. He hath sealed them in the air of
  | heaven. He hath distributed them through the planets. He hath assigned
  | unto them the twelve constellations of the universe.
* Hierophant places cross aside.
Hierophant:
  | The thirty-second Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, which answereth unto the
  | letter Tau ("ת"), is called the administrative intelligence, and it is so
  | called because it directeth and associateth in all their operations, the
  | seven planets, even all of them in their own due courses. To it, therefore,
  | is attributed the due knowledge of the seven abodes of Assiah (עֲשִׂיָּה), the
  | material world, which are symbolised in the Apocalypse by the seven churches
  footnote
    | JMG: The equation of the seven palaces of Assiah with the seven churches
    | of Asia is a staple of Christian Qabalah.
  | .

Hierophant:
  | It refers to the universe as composed of the four elements, to the Kerubim
  | (כְּרוּבִים), to the Qlippoth (קליפות / קְלִפּוֹת), and to the astral plane.
  | It is the reflection of the sphere of Saturn. It represents the connecting
  | and binding link between the material and formative worlds, Assiah (עֲשִׂיָּה)
  | and Yetsira (יְצִירָה), and necessarily passes through the astral plane,
  | the abode of the elementals and the shells of the dead. It is
  | the rending of the veil of the tabernacle, whereon the Kerubim and the palm
  | trees are depicted. It is the passing of the gate of Eden.
* Hierophant
  | rises and leads Zelator to the west of altar. He draws attention to the
  | key of the Universe.

Hierophant:
  | These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the
  | twenty-first key of the tarot in front of you. Within the oval formed of the
  | seventy-two circles, is a female form, nude save for a scarf that floats
  | round her. She is crowned with the lunar crescent of Isis and holds in her
  | hands two wands.  Her legs form a cross. She is the bride of the
  | Apocalypse, the Kabbalistic queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis or
  | great feminine Kerubic angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the mercy
  | seat of the ark.
Hierophant:
  | The wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents.
  | The seven pointed heptagram or star alludes to the seven palaces of Assiah;
  | the crossed legs to the symbol of the four letters of the name
  footnote
    | JMG: That is, YHVH, the Tetragrammaton.
  | .

Hierophant:
  | The surmounting crescent receives alike the influences of Geburah (גְּבוּרָה)
  | and Gedulah (גְדוּלָה). She is the synthesis of the thirty-second Path,
  | uniting Malkuth (מְלָכוֹת) to Yesod (יְסוֹד).
Hierophant:
  | The oval of the seventy-two smaller circles refers to the Schemhamphoresch
  | (השם המפורש / הַשֵּׁם הַמְּפֹרָשׁ),
  | or seventy-twofold name of the deity. The twelve larger
  | circles form the zodiac. At the angles are the four Kerubim (כְּרוּבִים), which are
  | the vivified powers of the letters of the name Yod He Vau He (יהוה) operating in
  | the elements, through which you have just symbolically passed in the preceding
  | ceremony.
Hierophant:
  | The fan, lamp, cup, and salt represent the four elements themselves, whose
  | inhabitants are the sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes.
Hierophant:
  | Be thou, therefore, prompt and active as the sylphs, but avoid frivolity and
  | caprice. Be energetic and strong as the salamanders, but avoid irritability
  | and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images, like the undines, but avoid
  | idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like the gnomes, but
  | avoid grossness and avarice.
Hierophant:
  | So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to
  | command the spirits of the elements.
Hierophant:
  | The altar, as in the preceding degree, represents the material universe. On
  | its right is symbolically the garden of Eden, represented by the station of
  | Hegemon, while on its left is symbolically Gehenna (גהנא), the abode of shells,
  | represented by the station of Keryx.
* Hierophant returns to his throne.
* Keryx steps forward and stands at Zelator’s left hand.
Hierophant:
  | I have much pleasure in conferring on you the title of Lord of the
  | thirty-second Path. You will now quit the temple for a short time, and on
  | your return the ceremony of your reception into the 2=9 grade of
  | Theoricus will be proceeded with.
* Keryx leads Zelator out.

* Keryx takes up caduceus badge.

Hierophant:
  | Frater Keryx, you have my commands to instruct the Zelator in the
  | proper alarm, and to present him with the necessary admission badge.
Hierophant:
  | Honoured Hegemon, guard the portal and admit them on giving the proper
  | alarm.
* Keryx
  | takes caduceus admission badge and brings Zelator to the door to
  | give the knocks.
* Hegemon
  | opens the door and leads Zelator in a little way and faces him to
  | Hierophant.
Hierophant:
  | Frater Periclinus de Faustis, as in the Zelator grade there were
  | given the symbolical representations of the Tree of Knowledge of Good
  | and of Evil, of the gate of Eden, and of the holy place, so in this grade of
  | Theoricus, the sanctum sanctorum with the ark and the Kerubim (כְּרוּבִים) is shown,
  | as well as the garden of Eden with which it coincides; while in the thirty-
  | second Path leading hereunto, through which you have just symbolically
  | passed, the Kerubic guardians are represented, and the palm trees or trees
  | of progression in the garden of Eden.
Hierophant:
  | Honoured Hegemon, conduct the Zelator to the west, and place him thus
  | before the portal of the thirty-second Path of Tau ("ת") by which he has
  | symbolically entered.
* Hegemon takes Zelator to west, before the portal.
* Candidate is faced to west
* Keryx returns to place.
Hiereus: By what symbol dost thou enter herein?
Hegemon:
  | By the peculiar emblem of the Keryx, which is the caduceus of Hermes.
* Candidate hands it to Hiereus
* Hiereus turns it towards Zelator, and reads:
Hiereus:
  | The Tree of Life and the three mother letters are the keys wherewith
  | to unlock the caduceus of Hermes. The upper point of the wand
  | on Kether (כֶּתֶר), and the wings stretch out to Chokmah (חׇכְמָה) and
  | Binah (בִּינָה), the three supernal Sephiroth (סְפִירוֹת).  The lower seven
  | are embraced by the serpents, whose heads fall upon
  | Chesed (חֶסֶד) and Geburah (גְּבוּרָה).
Hiereus:  
  | They are the twin serpents of Egypt — the currents of the Astral Light.
  | Furthermore, the wings and top of the wand form the letter Shin (ש),
  | the symbol of fire; the heads and upper halves of the serpents form
  | Aleph ("א"), the symbol of air; while their tails enclose Mem ("מ"),
  | the symbol of water. The fire of life above, the waters of creation
  | below, and the air symbol vibrating between them.
* Hierophant comes to the east of altar.
* Hegemon
  | directs Zelator to face him from the west of the altar, and then returns
  | to his place.

Hierophant:
  | The symbols before you represent alike the garden of Eden and the
  | holy of holies. Before you stands the Tree of Life formed of the
  | Sephiroth (סְפִירוֹת) and their connecting Paths. Into its complete symbolism,
  | it is impossible to enter here, for it is the key of all things when
  | rightly understood. Upon each Sephira (סְפִירָה) are written in Hebrew letters
  | its name, the divine names, and those of angels and archangels
  | attributed thereto.

  | The connecting Paths are twenty-two in number and are distinguished by
  | the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, making with the ten 
  | Sephiroth (סְפִירוֹת) themselves the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom of the
  | Sepher Yetzirah (סֵפֶר יְצִירָה).

  | Sword and Serpent (TODO own image)

Hierophant:
  | The course of the Hebrew letters, as placed on the Paths, forms as
  | you see, the symbol of the serpent of wisdom, while the natural succession
  | of the Sephiroth forms the flaming sword, and the course of the lightning
  | flash, as shown in the drawing below. The cross within the triangle, apex
  | downwards, placed upon the altar at the base of the Tree of Life, refers to
  | the four rivers of paradise, while the angles of the triangles refer to the
  | three Sephiroth — Netzach (נֶצַח), Hod (הוֹד), and Yesod (יְסוֹד).
  br
  br
  | The two pillars, right and left
  | of the Tree, are the symbols of active and passive, male and female, Adam
  | and Eve. They also allude to the pillars of fire and cloud which guided the
  | Israelites in the wilderness, and the hot and moist natures are further
  | marked by the red lamp and the cup of water.
Hierophant:
  | The pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the ark — the right,
  | Metatron, male, and the left, Sandalphon, female.
Hierophant:
  | Above them ever burn the lamps of their spiritual essence, of which they
  | are partakers in the eternal uncreated One.
* Hierophant stands in the sign of Theoricus.
Hierophant:
  | Glory be unto Thee, Lord of the Land of Life, for Thy splendour
  | filleth the universe.
* Hierophant pauses shortly, comes to the west of the altar, and says:
Hierophant:
  | The 2=9 grade of Theoricus is referred to Yesod (יְסוֹד), as the Zelator
  | grade is to Malkuth (מַלְכוּת). The Path between them is assigned to the
  | letter Tau ("ת"), whose portal you now see in the west, and through
  | which you have just symbolically passed.
Hierophant:
  | To this grade, as to those preceding it, certain signs and tokens 
  | are attributed. They consist of a sign, token, grand word, mystic
  | number, and password formed therefrom.
Hierophant:
  | The sign is thus given. Stand with feet together and raise both arms
  | upwards and back, palms up, as if supporting a weight, thus (makes sign). It
  | represents you in the Path of Yesod (יְסוֹד), supporting the pillars of mercy and
  | severity. It is the sign made by the Greek god Atlas, who supported the
  | universe on his shoulders and whom Hercules was directed to emulate. It is
  | the Isis of nature, supporting the heavens.
Hierophant:
  | The grip is that of the First Order, which you received in the preceding
  | grade.
Hierophant:
  | The grand word is a name of seven letters, Shaddai El Chai
  | (שַׁדַּי אֵל חַי), which means the almighty and living one.
Hierophant:
  | The mystic number is forty-five, and from it is formed the password which
  | is Mem He, the secret name of the world of formation. It should be lettered
  | separately when given.
Hierophant:
  | Unto this grade and unto the Sephirah Yesod, the ninth Path of the Sepher
  | Yetzirah is referred. It is called the pure and clear intelligence, and it is
  | so called because it purifieth and maketh clear the Sephiroth, proveth and
  | emendeth the forming of their representation, and disposeth their duties or
  | harmonies, wherein they combine, without mutilation or division.
Hierophant:
  | The distinguishing badge of this grade, which you are now entitled to
  | wear, is the sash of the Zelator, with the addition of a white cross above the
  | triangle and the numbers two and nine in a circle and square respectively,
  | left and right of its summit — and beneath the triangle, the number
  | thirty-two between two narrow parallel white lines.
  
* Hierophant returns to east and sits down.
* Hegemon guides Zelator to him.

Hierophant:
  | The three portals facing you are the gates of Paths leading from
  | this grade. That on the right connects with the grade of Philosophus, that
  | on your left with the grade of Practicus, while the central one leads to the
  | Portal.
Hierophant:
  | This grade especially refers to the element of air, and therefore the great
  | watchtower or terrestrial tablet of the east forms one of its principal
  | emblems. It is one of the four great tablets delivered unto Enoch by the great
  | angel Ave.
Hierophant:
  | From it are drawn the three holy secret names of God, ORO IBAH AOZPI, which
  | are borne upon the Banner of the East, and numberless
  | divine and angelic names which appertain unto the element of air.
Hierophant:
  | To the moon, also, is this grade related. Its kamea or mystical square is
  | shown in the east, with seals and names appropriate thereto.
Hierophant:
  | It is also shown inscribed upon the Tree of Life, whereon its crescent in
  | increase represents the side of mercy—in decrease the side of severity,
  | while at the full it reflects the sun of Tiphareth (תִּפְאֶרֶת).
  
* Hegemon conducts Zelator to a seat west of the altar.
Hierophant:
  | I now congratulate you on having attained the grade of Theoricus
  | and in recognition thereof, I confer upon you the mystic title of Poraios
  | de Rejectis which means “brought from among the rejected,” and I give you
  | the symbol of ruach (רוּחַ), which is the Hebrew name for air.
* Hiero ✊
Hierophant: Frater Keryx, you have my command to declare that the Zelator
  | has been duly advanced to the grade of Theoricus.
Keryx:
  | In the name of Shaddai El Chai (שַׁדַּי אֵל חַי), and by command of the very
  | honoured Hierophant, hear ye all that I proclaim that our Frater
  | ${candidateMotto;b}, having made sufficient progress in the study of
  | occult science, has been duly advanced to the 2=9 grade of Theoricus,
  | lord of the thirty-second Path, and that he has received the mystic
  | title of Poraios de Rejectis, and the symbol of ruach (רוּחַ).
  
Hierophant:
  | Frater ${candidateMotto;b}, before you are eligible for advancement to the next
  | grade, you must be perfect in certain subjects, a manuscript of which will
  | be supplied to you.

Hierophant:
  | “Spirit of life! Spirit of wisdom! Whose breath 
  | giveth forth and withdraweth the form of all things: 
  br
  br
  | “Thou, before whom the life of beings is but a shadow which changeth,
  | and a vapour which passeth:
  br
  br
  | “Thou, who mountest upon the clouds, and who walkest upon the wings
  | of the wind.
  br
  br
  | “Thou, who breathest forth Thy breath, and endless space is peopled:
  br
  br
  | “Thou, who drawest in Thy breath, and all that cometh from Thee,
  | returneth unto Thee!
  br
  br
  | “Ceaseless motion, in eternal stability, be Thou eternally blessed!
  br
  br
  | “We praise Thee and we bless Thee in the changeless empire of created
  | light, of shades, of reflections, and of images;
  br
  br
  | “And we aspire without cessation unto Thy immutable and imperishable
  | brilliance.
  br
  br
  | “Let the ray of Thy intelligence and the warmth of Thy love penetrate even
  | unto us!
  br
  br
  | “Then that which is volatile shall be fixed; the shadow shall be a body; the
  | spirit of air shall be a soul; the dream shall be a thought.
  br
  br
  | “And no more shall we be swept away by the tempest, but we shall hold
  | the bridles of the winged steeds of dawn.
  br
  br
  | “And we shall direct the course of the evening breeze to fly before Thee!
  br
  br
  | “O Spirit of Spirits! O eternal Soul of Souls!
  br
  br
  | “O imperishable breath of life! O creative sigh! O mouth which breathest
  | forth and withdrawest the life of all beings, in the flux and reflux of thine
  | eternal Word, which is the divine ocean of movement and of truth!”

* Hierophant
  | makes with sceptre the banishing circle and pentagrams in
  | the air before the tablet.
Hierophant:
  | Depart ye in peace unto your habitations. May the blessing of Yod
  | He Vau He (יהוה) rest with ye. Be there peace between us and you, and be
  | ye ready to come when ye are called.
* All return to their places.
Hierophant:
  | In the name of Shaddai El Chai, I declare this temple closed in the 2=9
  | grade of Theoricus.
