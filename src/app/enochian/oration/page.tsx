      O Almighty, Ã†ternal, The True & Living God: O King of Glory, O Lord of
      Hosts, O Thou, the Creator of Heaven & Earth, & of all things visible &
      invisible: Now, (even now, at length,) among other Thy manifold mercies
      used, & to be used toward me, Thy simple servant, ____________, I most
      humbly beseech Thee, in this my present petition to have mercy upon me, to
      have pity upon me, to have compassion upon me. I, faithfully & sincerely,
      of long time, have sought among men, in Earth, & also by prayer (full oft
      & pitifully) have made suit unto Thy Divine Majesty for the obtaining of
      some convenient portion of True Knowledge & Understanding of Thy laws &
      ordinances, established in the natures & properties of Thy Creatures: By
      which Knowledge, Thy Divine Wisdom, Power & Goodness (on Thy Creatures
      bestowed & to them imparted), being to me made & allure me, (for the same)
      incessantly to pronounce Thy praises, to render unto Thee, most hearty
      thanks, to advance Thy true honour, & to win unto Thy Name, some of Thy
      due Majestic Glory, among all people, & forever. And, whereas, it hath
      pleased Thee (O God) of Thy infinite Goodness, by Thy faithful & holy
      Spiritual Messengers, to deliver unto me, long since (through the eye and
      ear of E. K.) an orderly form, & manner of exercise Heptarchical: How, (to
      Thy Honour & Glory, & the Comfort of my own poor soul, & of others, Thy
      faithful servants,) I may, at all times, use very many of Thy good Angels,
      their counsels & helps; according to the properties of such their
      functions, & offices, as to them, by Thy Divine Power, Wisdom & Goodness,
      is assigned, & limited: (Which orderly form, & manner of exercise, until
      even now, I never found opportunity & extreme necessity, to apply myself
      unto,) Therefore, I thy poor, & simple servant, do most humbly, heartily,
      & faithfully beseech Thy Divine Majesty, most lovingly & fatherly to
      favour: and by Thy Divine Beck to further this my present industry &
      endeavour to exercise myself, according to the foresaid orderly forme &
      manner: and, now, (at length, but not too late) for Thy dearly deloved Son
      JESUS CHRIST His Sake, (O Heavenly Father) to grant also unto me, this
      blessing & portion of Thy heavenly Graces: That Thou wilt fortwith, enable
      me, make me apt & acceptable, (in body, soul & spirit) to enjoy always the
      holy & friendly conversation, with the sensible, plain, full, & perfect
      help, in word & deed, of Thy Mighty, Wise & Good Spiritual Messengers &
      Ministers generally: &, namely, of Blessed Michael, Blessed Gabriel,
      Blessed Raphael, & Blessed Uriel; & also especially, of all those, which
      do appertain unto the Heptarchical Mystery, theurgically, (as yet) & very
      briefly unto me declared: under the method of Seven Mighty Kings, & their
      Seven Faithful & Princely Ministers, with their subjects & servants, to
      them belonging. And in this Thy great Mercy & Grace, on me bestowed, & to
      me confirmed, (O Almighty God,) Thou shalt, (to the great comfort of Thy
      faithful servants,) approve, to Thy very enemies, & mine, the truth &
      certainty of Thy manifold, most merciful promises, heretofore, made unto
      me: and that Thou art the True & Almighty God, Creator of Heaven & Earth,
      (upon whom I do call & in whom I put all my trust,) & Thy Ministers, to be
      the true, & faithful Angels of light: which have, hitherto, principally, &
      according to Thy Divine providence dealth with us: And, also, I, thy poor
      & simple servant, shall then, In & By Thee, be better able to serve Thee,
      according to Thy well pleasing: to Thy Honour & Glory: Yea, even in these
      most miserable, & lamentable days. Grant, Oh grant, O our Heavenly Father,
      grant this, (I pray Thee,) for Thy only begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, His
      sake: Amen, Amen, Amen.
